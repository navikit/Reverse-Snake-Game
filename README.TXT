1) Name: Ivan Chio
2) Name of game: Reverse Snake 101
3) How to compile game: 
	  To compile game you must compile both Snake.java and Main.java
4) Outside package requirements: 
	  Animation.java, Sprite.java, Runnable.java, KeyListener.java
5) How to interact with game: 
      1) To play the game you use the arrow keys to get as many blocks as possible
      2) However whenever your score is an odd number, excluding 0, your moves are reversed, opposite of what you press. And the background color will change accordingly. (Magenta = regular ; Pink = reversed)
      3) You can pass through youself, BUT CANNOT go through wall!! (TIP: KEEP TRACK OF WHERE YOU ARE WHEN YOU GET A HIGH SCORE OTHERWISE YOU RISK GETTING LOST WITHIN YOUSELF,iNcEpTiOn)
6) Goals for player:
	  The goals of the player is to get as many blocks as you can without hitting the walls, whereas you can pass through yourself, without losing.
7) Winning condition:
 	  You will win when you are able to have the snake the size of the playing field.
8) Losing condition:
	  You will lose when you hit any sides of the wall.
	  YOU WILL NOT LOSE WHEN YOU PASS THROUGH YOURSELF!!!!!
9) Unresolved issue with program:
	  I was going to make it where you would lose when you pass through youself but when I tried playing it, the game became too difficult to play. Especially accounting for the moves reversing every move excluding the first 2 move.
	  Also since I used JPanel insead of sprite, I was unable to figure out how to find when the sprites are overlapping.
